The file CESM_ice_sheets_documentation.pdf is the documentation for
the version of CISM included in the CESM1.1 release. This also
includes documentation of other aspects of CESM relevant to ice sheet
modeling.

The file glimmer_doc.pdf is the documentation for GLIMMER version
1.5.1. This is similar, but not identical, to the version that is
included in the CESM1.1 release.
