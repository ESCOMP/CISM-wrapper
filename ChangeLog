One-line summary: Restore "correct" glc_time_management, with fix for compiler bug

Purpose of changes:

Return glc_time_management to its "correct" state - i.e., before the changes
made in cism1_111220a; introduce unused module variable in glc_time_management
to get around an internal compiler error in xlf. Also, move incorrectly-placed
'implicit none' in glc_time_management_test.F90.

Changes answers relative to previous tag: No, but replaces functionality removed
in cism1_111220a

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID) (http://bugs.cgd.ucar.edu/):

Known bugs (include bugzilla ID) (http://bugs.cgd.ucar.edu/):
      1433 (time manager needs additional changes to support longer timesteps)
      1441 (time manager doesn't restart properly when last run stopped in the middle of a day)

Summary of testing: 

- Tested build for an IGCN case

- Full cesm system tests pending, including bluefire.glc.auxtest with comparison
  to beta07 (needed to create this tag before testing was complete, but I will
  create a new tag if any fail)

Purpose of changes:

temporarily rolled this file back to the version in 31393.

This should be fixed ASAP!

Summary of testing: No system tests, but many unit tests

- test/unit/time_management (tests in testlist & restart_testlist; for testlist,
  performed regression tests against code similar to cism1_111026 where
  possible, manually checked output where regression tests were impossible -
  e.g., where the old code was buggy):

Note that there is a known bug in newhour (see bug 1433). I am considering tests
to have passed even if they have the wrong newhour value. Also, since I didn't
do a careful look at every variable output by the test driver, it's possible
that there are errors in other variables that I didn't catch. Here, I am just
listing tests that have failures in variables that I checked, other than
newhour (variables I checked more carefully were: iyear, imonth, iday,
seconds_this_day, eoy, eom, eod, adjust_nyears, elapsed_days, elapsed_months,
elapsed_years).

All pass except:

  oneyear_leap: model doesn't run to completion (see bug 1433)

  threeyear_leap: also has problems related to bug 1433, though here the model
    runs to completion

  219day_leap: also has problems related to bug 1433; the first error I notice
    is that year 5, day_of_year 73 is translated to 0005-mar-13 rather than
    0005-mar-14, but there are likely other errors, too, as for oneyear_leap

  511day_leap: also has problems relatd to bug 1433; e.g., both the leap and the
    non-leap tests have a time step with time stamp 0005-mar-15; the leap should
    differ

Version: cism1_111122
One-line summary: Modified time manager to support longer time steps

Previously, the time manager did not correctly handle time steps longer
than one month. With the changes here, time steps as long as desired
should be possible. However, as noted below, I have only tested this for
daily and annual time steps so far.
	
M       source_glc/glc_time_management.F90

pretag testing: so far I have tested this for daily and annual time steps;
more testing is needed of other length time steps

	- 10-year TG compset with daily time step (i.e., the default),
	using gland10 and 10 years of forcing from a af19_g16 IG compset:
	last year of cism history output identical to a similar run set up
	using old version; cism log files also essentially identical

	- Similar to the above, but with annual time step & annual
	coupling interval. This was set up by (1) averaging the 10 years
	of cpl history files into annual-average files; (2) explicitly
	setting atm_cpl_dt to 31536000, and the same for other components,
	in cpl.buildnml.csh; (3) changing dt_option from steps_per_day to
	steps_per_year in cism.buildnml.csh. Last year of cism history
	output identical to the daily run; cism log files also show
	correct time stepping

	- exact restart, daily time step: similar to daily time step run
	above, but two 5-year runs; checked last year of history file
	against the above 10-year run

	- exact restart, annual time step: similar to annual time step run
	above, but two 5-year runs; checked last year of history file
	against the above 10-year run

One-line summary: change ntem default to 1000000. for gland5UM

This turns off ice temperature evolution (I think) -- at least, as long as
you are running for less than 1000000 years. This change should have been
made at the same time as the creation of ice.config.gland5UM, when
evolution was (correctly) set to -1.

pretag testing:
	- 10-year TG compsets before and after these modifications

	f19_g16 IG compset: last year of cism history output identical

	- 10-year TG compset with evolution=-1, compared with the above
	evolution=0 case: last year of cism history output differs, as
	expected (but didn't evaluate whether the differences make sense)

                  except the var.def files have been removed from the bld as well
                  as the scripts to handle them.  CSEG decided not to require
                  python, which one of the scripts uses, so the resulting _io.F90
                  files are included in source_glimmer-cism instead.

Set up grid files for 48x96, 1.9x.25, and 0.9x1.25 resolutions. Abort
if it isn't one of those. Also remove the coupled_nml namelist as not needed,
and set the stop_option to never, since, the coupler will tell it to stop.

One-line summary:  Upgrade from ccsm3 to ccsm4 coupling

- Try not to touch any glimmer code	
- Delete unusued code and remove use of unused code from used code as needed
- Add bld and gglc.cpl7.template
- Delete glc.F90 and add glc_comp_mct.F90 for migration from ccsm3 to ccsm4
- Update the stdout, stderr, and nml unit numbers to be set from shr_file_getunit,
  eliminate use of local get_unit in favor of shr_file_getunit in glc
- Migrate all use of unit 6 to stdout in all source_glc code.  includes write,
  print, and flush statements.  this was not done to glimmer.
- Add a shr_sys_abort to source_glimmer/glimmer_log.F90 before the stop to
  prevent ccsm4 hang from glimmer abort.  (there are probably more calls to
  stop that need to be fixed in the code).
- Get rid of use and reference to ccsm3 coupling code
- Update initialization of glc communicator from ccsm4 driver

Other potential issues still not addressed
- other unit numbers hardwired in glc/glimmer
- use of stop, proper aborts
- reference to gland20.input.nc file from ice.config input file
- hardwired glc_nec = 10
- hardwired T31 resolution
- glimmer mostly writes to unit 6
- restart flag captured in coupling interface but not used
