(2019-02-01) Note from Bill Sacks:

I'm not sure whether the tools here are actually needed for anything any
more. I figure we can leave them in place for a few more years, and if
we haven't used them in that time, then we can remove them. If we do use
them, then we can update the documentation as needed.

Here was a note I had to myself from a few years ago:

(2016-01-22): Update documentation in CISM's tools directory: The
current documentation is for making an fglcmask file. I am removing
this, replacing it with a raw data file for CLM's mksurfdata_map. I'm
planning to document that in a README file that accompanies the raw data
file. I may want to incorporate these instructions into GLC's tools
directory, in place of the existing README. Along with that, I should
remove no-longer-used tools there: I *think* the tool for making a scrip
grid file is no longer needed, but I should double-check that (I *think*
it was a bit wrong, so Jeremy did this a different way... and now, for
the sake of making the raw data file, we can assume that we already have
a correct SCRIP grid file).
