Purpose of changes:

Standalone checkout supported in this tag (Yes/No):
   (If yes, this implies that we expect to be able to build and run a
   case from a standalone checkout using manage_externals, and for this
   to continue to work long-term. The answer may be "No" if the set of
   externals pointed to by manage_externals is broken, or if at least
   one external points to a temporary branch that is may be deleted in
   the near future.)

   If No: Notes on externals used for testing:
