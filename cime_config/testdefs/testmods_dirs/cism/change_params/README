This testmod value tests changing parameters in a multiple ice sheet run
(with both Antarctica and Greenland) via setting different user_nl
values for each ice sheet. The point of this is largely to test the
buildnml code, but I can't think of an easy way to just cover the
buildnml code.

The ideal way to use this testmod is in a test that compares a multiple
ice sheet run with a single ice sheet run, though it can also work to
include it in any test with multiple ice sheets. (In the latter case,
the baseline comparisons would be doing most of the work to ensure that
things are working correctly.)

This testmod includes:

(1) A parameter value set in user_nl_cism that applies to both ice
    sheets (flow_factor)

(2) A parameter value that is set to one thing in user_nl_cism but then
    overridden with different values in user_nl_cism_ais and
    user_nl_cism_gris (so there are 3 different values in total; the ice
    sheet-specific values should override the general value)
    (effstrain_min).
