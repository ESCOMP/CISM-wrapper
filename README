This directory contains the CCSM3 ice sheet model.  It is under
construction by Bill Lipscomb (LANL) and Jon Wolfe (NCAR).

The heart of the model is the GLIMMER code.  GLIMMER is an ice
sheet model originally developed by Tony Payne and colleagues
at the University of Bristol.  GLIMMER version 1.0.0 was released
in February 2007 and is the starting point for the CCSM ice sheet
model.  Here is the link to the GLIMMER developers' page:
http://forge.nesc.ac.uk/projects/glimmer/.

Files with the prefixes "glimmer", "glint", and "glide" are part of 
the GLIMMER release.  GLINT is the interface between the ice sheet
and climate models.  GLIDE is the dynamical core.

Files with the prefix "glc" have been added to enable GLIMMER to
run in the CCSM framework.  These are mainly drivers (e.g., glc.F90,
glc_RunMod.F90), communication routines (e.g., glc_boundary.F90),
and utilities (e.g., glc_kinds_mod.F90, glc_timers.F90).

Files with the prefix "glissade" are part of an alternate dynamical
core under development at LANL.
