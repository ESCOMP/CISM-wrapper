This directory contains the CCSM4 dynamic ice sheet model.

The heart of the model is the Glimmer code, contained in the source_glimmer
directory.  Glimmer is an ice sheet model originally developed by Tony Payne
and colleagues at the University of Bristol.  GLIMMER version 1.0.0 was released
in February 2007 and is the starting point for the CCSM ice sheet model.  

Glimmer is now evolving rapidly.  A new version, known as Glimmer-CISM,
will replace the existing code sometime in fall 2009.

Files with the prefix "glc" have been added to enable Glimmer to
run in the CCSM framework.  These files are in the source_glc directory.
