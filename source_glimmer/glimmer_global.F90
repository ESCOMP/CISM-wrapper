module glimmer_global

  !*FD Module holding global variables for Glimmer. Holds real-type
  !*FD kind values, and other global code parameters.

  use glimmer_vers

  integer,parameter :: sp = kind(1.0) 
  
  !*FD Single precision --- Fortran single-precision real-type kind 
  !*FD value. Used internally.
  !*FD
  !*FD Note that if the code is being compiled with forced typing (e.g. with 
  !*FD the -r8 flag), then this parameter may need to be set in agreement with 
  !*FD that.

  integer,parameter :: dp = kind(1.0d0) 
  
  !*FD Double precision --- Fortran double-precision real-type kind 
  !*FD value. Used internally.
  !*FD
  !*FD Note that if the code is being compiled with forced typing (e.g. with
  !*FD the -r8 flag), then this parameter may need to be set in agreement
  !*FD with that

#ifdef GLIMMER_SP

  integer,parameter :: rk=sp

#else

  integer,parameter :: rk=dp

#endif

  !*FD Precision of glimmer module --- the general Fortran real-type kind value 
  !*FD for the Glimmer module and its interfaces.
  !*FD
  !*FD Note that if the code is being compiled with forced typing (e.g. with 
  !*FD the -r8 flag), then this parameter must be set in agreement with that. 

  integer,parameter :: fname_length=100

  !*FD Specifies the length of character string variables used to
  !*FD hold filenames.

  character, parameter :: dirsep = '/'
  !*FD directory separator

  character, parameter :: linefeed = achar(10)
  character, parameter :: char_ret = achar(13)
  character(2), parameter :: cr_lf = char_ret//linefeed
  character, parameter :: endline = linefeed
  !*FD ASCII linefeed and carriage-return characters,
  !*FD and set up default newline appropriate for UNIX-type systems
