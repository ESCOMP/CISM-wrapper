Version: release-cesm2.0.04
One-line summary: Fixes for new NAG compiler on hobart

Purpose of changes:

   Update the source_cism external to pull in some changes that are
   needed for NAG 6.2 on hobart.

   These changes are equivalent to those in cism2_1_62, but pointing to
   the release branch for source_cism. cism2_1_62 has been merged in to
   mark this branch as up-to-date with that tag on master.

Standalone checkout supported in this tag (Yes/No): Yes
   (If yes, this implies that we expect to be able to build and run a
   case from a standalone checkout using manage_externals, and for this
   to continue to work long-term. The answer may be "No" if the set of
   externals pointed to by manage_externals is broken, or if at least
   one external points to a temporary branch that is may be deleted in
   the near future.)

   If No: Notes on externals used for testing:

Changes answers relative to previous tag: NO

Bugs fixed (include github issue number):
- https://github.com/ESCOMP/cism/issues/6

Summary of testing:

   Full aux_glc test suite on cheyenne and hobart

   All cheyenne tests passed and were bit-for-bit.

   Some hobart tests failed:

Version: release-cesm2.0.03
One-line summary: Minor updates to source_cism; support additional config options

Purpose of changes:

   - Update source_cism; main changes are:

     - Added a depth-dependent bmlt_float option

     - Allow more characters in message string

   - Support additional config options: some are related to the new
     bmlt_float option, others had accidentally been left out

   This brings us up to date with master version cism2_1_61 (including
   the changes in cism2_1_59 and cism2_1_60).

Standalone checkout supported in this tag (Yes/No): Yes
   (If yes, this implies that we expect to be able to build and run a
   case from a standalone checkout using manage_externals, and for this
   to continue to work long-term. The answer may be "No" if the set of
   externals pointed to by manage_externals is broken, or if at least
   one external points to a temporary branch that is may be deleted in
   the near future.)

   If No: Notes on externals used for testing:

Changes answers relative to previous tag: No

Bugs fixed (include github issue number): None

Summary of testing:

   aux_glc test suite, just on cheyenne

Version: release-cesm2.0.02
One-line summary: Update externals used in standalone checkout

Purpose of changes:

   Update externals to cesm2.0 release or later

   This is equivalent to the change on master in cism2_1_61

Standalone checkout supported in this tag (Yes/No): Yes
   (If yes, this implies that we expect to be able to build and run a
   case from a standalone checkout using manage_externals, and for this
   to continue to work long-term. The answer may be "No" if the set of
   externals pointed to by manage_externals is broken, or if at least
   one external points to a temporary branch that is may be deleted in
   the near future.)

   If No: Notes on externals used for testing:

Changes answers relative to previous tag: YES

   Just changes answers for standalone checkout, due to:

   - New version of CTSM (and MOSART, but that probably didn't change
     answers)

   - CIME update changes gnu compiler version on cheyenne, and possibly
     other changes

Bugs fixed (include github issue number): None

Summary of testing:

   aux_glc test suite just on cheyenne

Version: release-cesm2.0.01
One-line summary: Parameter and code changes to achieve greater stability

Purpose of changes:

   In multi-century T1850G runs, there were instances of
   instability. This tag has some parameter changes and minor code
   changes, all from Bill Lipscomb, in order to achieve greater
   stability.

   Also: changes some _tavg fields to their instantaneous versions:
   There seems to be an issue with writing _tavg fields from CESM (which
   we'll have to figure out at some point: see
   https://github.com/ESCOMP/cism-wrapper/issues/15).

   The changes in this tag are identical to the changes in cism2_1_58

Standalone checkout supported in this tag (Yes/No): Yes
   (If yes, this implies that we expect to be able to build and run a
   case from a standalone checkout using manage_externals, and for this
   to continue to work long-term. The answer may be "No" if the set of
   externals pointed to by manage_externals is broken, or if at least
   one external points to a temporary branch that is may be deleted in
   the near future.)

   If No: Notes on externals used for testing:

Changes answers relative to previous tag: YES

   - Changes answers for cases with CISM2%EVOLVE

   - For CISM2%NOEVOLVE, no meaningful changes, but changes answers for
     these cism fields (presumably due to the change in dt):
     - internal_time
     - tstep_count

   Note, though, that this tag is bit-for-bit with cism2_1_58

Bugs fixed (include github issue number): None

   external.

Standalone checkout supported in this tag (Yes/No): Yes

   case from a standalone checkout using manage_externals, and for this

   externals pointed to by manage_externals is broken, or if at least
   one external points to a temporary branch that is may be deleted in

   If No: Notes on externals used for testing:

Changes answers relative to previous tag: NO - bit-for-bit with cism2_1_57
